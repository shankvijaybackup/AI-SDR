    {
      "objection": "We already use ServiceNow/Jira/Freshservice",
      "response": "That's great! Atomicwork actually integrates with ServiceNow, Jira, and Freshservice. We don't replace them - we add an AI layer on top that makes them 10x easier to use. Your employees never have to log into a portal again. They just ask Atom in Slack, and it handles the ServiceNow ticket creation, routing, and updates behind the scenes.",
      "follow_up": "Most customers keep their existing ITSM but see 40-60% ticket deflection because Atom resolves common requests instantly."
    },
    {
      "objection": "How is this different from a chatbot?",
      "response": "Great question! Traditional chatbots follow decision trees and can only answer FAQs. Atom is an agentic AI - it actually takes actions. It can reset passwords, provision access, approve requests, create tickets, and even execute workflows across multiple systems. It's like having a junior IT admin available 24/7 for every employee.",
      "follow_up": "Plus, Atom learns from your organization's knowledge graph, so responses are personalized and permission-aware."
    },
    {
      "objection": "We're not ready for AI yet",
      "response": "I totally understand the hesitation. Here's the thing - your employees are already using AI tools like ChatGPT for work questions. The question isn't whether to use AI, but whether you want a controlled, secure AI that's trained on your company's policies and integrated with your systems. Atom gives you that control.",
      "follow_up": "We can start with a pilot - just IT password resets and access requests. Low risk, high impact."
    },
    {
      "objection": "What about security and compliance?",
      "response": "Security is built into our DNA. We're SOC 2 Type II certified, GDPR compliant, and support SSO with all major identity providers. Every action Atom takes is logged with full audit trails. Plus, Atom respects your existing RBAC - it only shows and does what each user is permitted to see and do.",
      "follow_up": "Many of our customers are in regulated industries like finance and healthcare. Happy to connect you with references."
    },
    {
      "objection": "This sounds expensive",
      "response": "Let me flip that - what's the cost of your IT team spending 1500+ hours a year on repetitive access requests and password resets? Or employees waiting hours or days for simple approvals? Our typical customer sees ROI in under 6 months just from IT labor savings alone.",
      "follow_up": "We price per employee, starting around $8-12/user/month. Most customers save 3-5x that in productivity gains."
    },
    {
      "objection": "We don't have the resources to implement this",
      "response": "That's exactly why we built Atomicwork! Implementation is 2-4 weeks, not 6-12 months like legacy ITSM. We come with 100+ pre-built skills out of the box - password resets, access requests, PTO approvals, etc. You're not building from scratch.",
      "follow_up": "Our team handles the heavy lifting. You just need to dedicate a few hours for configuration and testing."
    },
    {
      "objection": "Our employees won't adopt it",
      "response": "Actually, adoption is our strongest metric! Employees love Atom because it meets them where they already work - Slack, Teams, email. No new portal to learn, no tickets to track. They just ask a question and get an answer. We typically see 70-80% adoption in the first month.",
      "follow_up": "Think about it - would your employees rather log into a portal and fill out a form, or just type 'reset my password' in Slack?"
    },
    {
      "objection": "What if it gives wrong answers?",
      "response": "Great question. Atom is trained on your specific knowledge base and policies, so it's not making things up. For complex issues it can't handle, it automatically escalates to a human with full context. Plus, you have admin controls to review and approve responses before they go live.",
      "follow_up": "We also provide analytics showing you exactly what Atom is handling vs. escalating, so you can continuously improve."
    },
    {
      "objection": "We need to see a demo first",
      "response": "Absolutely! I'd love to show you Atom in action. How about I set up a 30-minute demo next week? I can show you password resets, access provisioning, and how it integrates with your existing tools. I'll even customize it with your company's branding so you can see exactly how it would work for your team.",
      "follow_up": "What day works better for you - Tuesday or Thursday?"
    },
    {
      "objection": "We're in the middle of other projects",
      "response": "I hear you - IT always has a full plate. Here's the thing: Atomicwork actually frees up your team to focus on those strategic projects by automating the repetitive stuff. Imagine getting back 20-30% of your IT team's time currently spent on password resets and access requests.",
      "follow_up": "We can start small - just one use case like password resets. Quick win, minimal disruption."
